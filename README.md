# NitroType-Hacker-
A bookmarklet to make any key that you press in a nitrotype race be marked as correct.
To use, go into a race and press the bookmarklet.
Then press keys, and it will make nearly all of them correct.
The amount correct changes every time you activate the bookmarklet. 
Don't spam keys to fast or nitrotype will detect it.
Also, I'm not to blame if you lose your account due to this.
If you get banned, its permanent.
Have fun (:
