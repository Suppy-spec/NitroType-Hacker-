# NitroType-Exploit-
A bookmarklet to make any key that you press in a nitrotype race be marked as correct.
To use, go into a race and press the bookmarklet.
Then press keys, and it will make nearly all of them correct.
The amount correct changes every time you activate the bookmarklet. 
Don't spam keys to fast or nitrotype will detect it.
Also, I'm not to blame if you lose your account due to this.
If you get banned, its permanent.
Have fun (:

Edit: Recently realized I left something in the code that was meant to make it obvious in testing if the commands were running
I'm not removing this, because if your actually trying to cheat in a typing game, you need a little bit of misery.
Its not malicious though...
~~Or is it?~~ Its not just wanted to say something.
